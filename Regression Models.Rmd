The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models). I will then answer two questions
“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
“Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions”

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)

boxplot(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars, xlab = "Transmission", ylab = "Miles per gallon", main="Miles per gallon by Transmission Type")

aggregate(mpg~am, data = mtcars, mean)
auto <- mtcars[mtcars$am == 0,]
manual <- mtcars[mtcars$am == 1,]
t.test(auto$mpg, manual$mpg)
m<-lm(mpg~am,data=mtcars)
summary(m)
model <- lm(mpg~am + wt + hp + cyl, data = mtcars)
anova(m,model)
summary(model)
plot(model)
```

Hence, the residuals are normally distributed
